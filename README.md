<h1>Image Classification and Processing Using Deep Learning</h1>

<p>This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for image analysis. It focuses on image classification and processing. The project involves loading image data, performing preprocessing steps, and applying a deep learning model to classify or analyze the images.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Image loading and preprocessing using <strong>ImageIO</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong>.</li>
  <li>Deep learning model implementation for image classification.</li>
  <li>Handling of image data in various formats, with warnings about deprecated functions.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of model performance based on accuracy and other metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The project uses a custom dataset or publicly available image dataset for training and testing. Images are loaded and preprocessed before being passed into a deep learning model for classification or analysis.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>imageio</code> (for loading images)</li>
  <li><code>numpy</code></li>
  <li><code>matplotlib</code> (for visualizing images)</li>
  <li><code>tensorflow</code> or <code>pytorch</code> (depending on the deep learning framework used)</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the dependencies using:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>This project implements a deep learning model for image classification. The model architecture can be either a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet, depending on the complexity of the task and the size of the dataset.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>The model is trained on the preprocessed image data using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance during and after training.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The project evaluates the model's performance on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics. Visualizations of sample predictions and classification results are provided to demonstrate the model's effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>You can adjust the following aspects of the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Model architecture</strong>: Modify the deep learning model (e.g., CNN, ResNet) used for image classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Use different image datasets or adjust the preprocessing steps for different image formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Training parameters</strong>: Tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.</li>
</ul>
